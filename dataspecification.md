Open Crime Data Specification
===========================================

**What Data Should a Police Agency Release?**

An agency should release anything that would appear on a Daily Incident Log or Call Log (public information only). Most departments pull something from their RMS. SpotCrime offers Catapult to any agency who doesn’t have the ability to create a public file from their RMS.

We typically ask for Part I and II crime information since most agencies already compile this information for their UCR or NIBRS reporting. Our motto is the more information (as long as it’s public), the better. Our system can decipher and define an array of crime types, as well as sort through what information is important and what information is useless. Information typically not released is victim information, juvenile information, or information pertaining to an arrestee’s personal information.

**The Date Set Should Include:**
